## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a new bug report, please check the existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/theaniketraj/project-karl/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.

If you find a new bug, please provide a clear and detailed report including:

1. **A clear and descriptive title.**
2. **Steps to reproduce the bug:** Provide a minimal, reproducible example if possible.
3. **Expected behavior:** What did you expect to happen?
4. **Actual behavior:** What actually happened? Include error messages and stack traces if applicable.
5. **Environment details:** Your operating system, JDK version, Kotlin version, and the specific version of Project KARL you are using.

Use the "Bug Report" issue template if available.

## Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features and improvements! Before submitting:

1. Check the existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/theaniketraj/project-karl/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/theaniketraj/project-karl/discussions) (if enabled) to see if your idea has already been discussed.
2. Consider the project's core philosophy (privacy-first, local learning, composable). Does your suggestion align with these principles?

When submitting an enhancement suggestion, please include:

1. **A clear and descriptive title.**
2. **Detailed description:** Explain the enhancement and why it would be valuable. What problem does it solve?
3. **Motivation:** Why is this feature needed? What use cases does it enable?
4. **(Optional) Proposed implementation:** Any ideas on how it could be implemented?

Use the "Feature Request" issue template if available.

## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted` in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/theaniketraj/project-karl/issues). These are typically smaller, well-defined tasks suitable for newcomers.

Don't hesitate to ask questions on an issue thread if you need clarification before starting work!

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Prerequisites:**

- Git
- JDK (Java Development Kit) - Version 11 or later recommended (check project requirements).
- IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate) with the Kotlin plugin is the recommended IDE.

2. **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the [Project KARL repository page](https://github.com/theaniketraj/project-karl).

3. **Clone Your Fork:**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/theaniketraj/project-karl.git
  cd project-karl
  ```

1. **Add Upstream Remote:**

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/theaniketraj/project-karl.git
    ```

    *(Replace `theaniketraj` with the actual owner of the main repository if it's not you)*
2. **Import into IntelliJ IDEA:** Open IntelliJ IDEA and select "Open", then navigate to the cloned `project-karl` directory. IntelliJ should automatically detect the Gradle project. Allow it to sync and download dependencies.
3. **Build the Project:** Verify your setup by running the build from the terminal or IDE:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure an Issue Exists:** For non-trivial changes (bug fixes, features), ensure there's a corresponding GitHub Issue discussing the problem or enhancement. Assign yourself or comment that you're working on it.
2. **Create a Feature Branch:** Create a new branch off the `main` branch (or `develop` if that's the primary development branch) for your changes:

    ```bash
    # Fetch latest changes from upstream
    git fetch upstream
    # Ensure your main branch is up-to-date
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    # Create your feature branch
    git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-feature-name # e.g., feature/add-rnn-engine
    # Or for bug fixes:
    # git checkout -b fix/issue-123-description # e.g., fix/issue-123-preview-import
    ```

3. **Implement Your Changes:**
    - Write clear, maintainable code following the [Coding Style Guidelines](#coding-style-guidelines).
    - Add necessary tests ([Testing](#testing)).
    - Update documentation if needed.
4. **Test Your Changes:** Ensure all existing tests pass and your new tests cover your changes:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew check
    ```

5. **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) if you're comfortable with it.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add basic RNN implementation for LearningEngine"
    # Or: git commit -m "fix: Correct import path for Prediction model"
    ```

6. **Push Your Branch:** Push your changes to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-descriptive-feature-name
    ```

7. **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    - Go to your fork on GitHub.
    - Click the "Compare & pull request" button for your new branch.
    - Ensure the base repository and branch (`main` or `develop`) are correct.
    - Provide a clear title and description for your PR:
        - Link to the relevant GitHub Issue (e.g., "Closes #123").
        - Summarize the changes made.
        - Explain *why* these changes are needed.
        - Describe how you tested the changes.
    - Submit the PR.
8. **Code Review:** Project maintainers will review your PR. Address any feedback or requested changes by pushing new commits to your feature branch. The PR will update automatically.
9. **Merging:** Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR. Congratulations! üéâ

## Coding Style Guidelines

- Follow the official [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
- Use the IntelliJ IDEA Kotlin formatter (usually configured by default).
- Write clear, concise, and well-commented code where necessary. Focus on readability.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions within the codebase.

## Testing

- Contributions should include tests.
  
- **Unit Tests:** Use Kotlin's testing framework (likely via Kotlin Multiplatform testing libraries, built on JUnit 5 for JVM) for testing individual classes and functions, especially in `karl-core`. Place tests in the corresponding `src/<sourceSet>/kotlin/` directory (e.g., `src/commonTest/kotlin/`, `src/jvmTest/kotlin/`).
  
- **Integration Tests:** May be added for testing interactions between modules (e.g., ensuring the `karl-kldl` engine works correctly with `karl-core` APIs).

- Run all tests using `./gradlew check` before submitting a PR.
