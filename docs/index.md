# Welcome to the Project KARL Documentation

This is the official documentation for **Project KARL (Kotlin Adaptive Reasoning Learner)**, an open-source library for building privacy-first, on-device adaptive AI models.

Whether you are a developer looking to integrate KARL into your application, a contributor wanting to improve the core library, or just curious about the architecture of on-device AI, you've come to the right place.

## What is Project KARL?

Project KARL provides a framework and reference implementations for embedding intelligent, personalized features into applications without compromising user data privacy. Its core philosophy is built on **local-first processing**, where all learning and inference happen exclusively on the user's device.
