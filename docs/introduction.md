# Introduction to KARL

Project KARL (Kotlin Adaptive Reasoning Learner) is an open-source library for building **privacy-first, on-device adaptive AI models**. It provides a framework and reference implementations for integrating intelligent, personalized features into applications without compromising user data privacy.

## The Vision: AI That is Truly Yours

The core mission of KARL is to shift the paradigm of AI-driven personalization from the cloud to the user's device. We envision a future where software can intelligently adapt to individual users without requiring them to surrender control of their behavioral data. KARL is designed for applications where user trust, data locality, and offline capability are paramount.

### Why KARL? The Local-First Advantage

Traditional AI often relies on aggregating massive amounts of user data on centralized servers. This approach introduces significant challenges related to privacy, security, latency, and cost.

KARL addresses these issues by championing a **local-first approach**:

* **Privacy by Design:** All learning and inference happen exclusively on the user's device. No sensitive interaction data is sent to the cloud by default.
* **True Personalization:** Models start as a "blank slate" and adapt *solely* based on the individual user's actions, creating a deeply tailored experience.
* **Offline Capability:** Intelligent features remain fully functional without an internet connection.
* **User Control:** Users inherently control their data and the AI that learns from it.

### Key Features

* **Composable Container Architecture:** An isolated "sandbox" for each user's AI instance.
* **Incremental, On-Device Learning:** The AI continuously adapts with each new user interaction.
* **Pluggable Backend:** Interfaces for `LearningEngine` and `DataStorage` allow for custom implementations.
* **Kotlin-Native Stack:** Built with Kotlin Multiplatform, integrating seamlessly with modern Kotlin and Jetpack Compose applications.
* **Open-Source Core:** A transparent and community-driven foundation licensed under Apache 2.0.
