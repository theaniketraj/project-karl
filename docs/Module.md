# Project KARL Documentation

## Kotlin Adaptive Reasoning Learner

**Project KARL** is an open-source Kotlin library for building privacy-first, locally adaptive AI models that integrate seamlessly into applications using a unique composable container architecture.

## Core Philosophy

- 🧠 **Local & Adaptive Learning**: KARL learns directly from individual user actions within your application
- 🔒 **Privacy-First by Design**: Zero data egress - all learning happens exclusively on the user's device
- 🧩 **Composable Container Architecture**: Clear boundaries for AI scope enhance user trust and control
- 🤝 **Open-Source Core**: Transparent, community-driven development under Apache License 2.0
- 🚀 **Kotlin Native**: Built with Kotlin Multiplatform for seamless integration

## Project Modules

### Core Framework

- **[karl-core](karl-core/index.html)** - Core interfaces, data models, and API layer
- **[karl-kldl](karl-kldl/index.html)** - KotlinDL-based machine learning engine implementation

### Storage & Persistence

- **[karl-room](karl-room/index.html)** - Room database implementation for data persistence

### User Interface

- **[karl-compose-ui](karl-compose-ui/index.html)** - Jetpack Compose UI components for KARL visualization

## Getting Started

```kotlin
// Create a KARL container for a user
val container = Karl.forUser("user_123")
    .withLearningEngine(KLDLLearningEngine())
    .withDataStorage(RoomDataStorage(dao))
    .withDataSource(applicationDataSource)
    .withCoroutineScope(applicationScope)
    .build()

// Initialize and start learning
container.initialize()

// Feed interaction data
dataSource.recordInteraction(InteractionData(
    type = "button_click",
    details = mapOf("action" to "save_document"),
    timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis(),
    userId = "user_123"
))

// Get AI predictions
val predictions = container.getPredictions().collect { prediction ->
    // Use AI insights in your application
}
```

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Local & Adaptive Learning**: Learns directly from individual user behavior on-device
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: Zero data egress by default - all processing and storage are local
- 🧩 **Composable Container**: Manages AI state and logic within defined boundaries
- 🔧 **Pluggable Architecture**: Swap implementations for learning engines and data storage
- 📜 **User Instructions**: Define rules guiding AI behavior
- 🚀 **Kotlin Native**: Multiplatform core with excellent JVM/Compose integration

## Architecture

KARL is built around several key components:

1. **KarlContainer**: Central orchestrator for a user's AI instance
2. **LearningEngine**: AI model for training and prediction (e.g., KotlinDL implementation)
3. **DataStorage**: Persistent storage for model state and interaction history
4. **DataSource**: Application integration for capturing user behaviors

## Use Cases

- **Developer Tools**: Command suggestions, error prediction, personalized IDE layouts
- **Personal Productivity**: Adaptive task suggestions, habit tracking, focus modes
- **Content Recommendation**: On-device recommendations based on local interaction history
- **Adaptive UI**: Dynamic interface adjustments based on usage patterns
- **Smart Home Control**: Local preference learning without cloud dependency
- **Health & Wellness**: Personalized insights while maintaining HIPAA compliance
