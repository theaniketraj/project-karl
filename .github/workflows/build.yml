# Name of the workflow, which will be displayed on the "Actions" tab in GitHub

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
    # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
    # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        # "ubuntu-latest" is a good, cost-effective default for JVM/Kotlin projects
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        # A job is a sequence of steps
        steps:
            # Step 1: Check out your repository code
            # This action checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
            - name: Checkout repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v4

            # Step 2: Set up JDK
            # This action sets up a specific version of the Java Development Kit
            # Choose a version that matches your project's requirements (e.g., 11 or 17)
            - name: Set up JDK 17
              uses: actions/setup-java@v4

                  cache: "gradle" # Caches Gradle dependencies to speed up subsequent builds

            # Step 3: Make Gradle wrapper executable
            # On some systems (especially after checking out on Windows), the gradlew script might lose its executable permission
            - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
              run: chmod +x gradlew

            # Step 4: Build the project with Gradle
            # This is the main command that compiles your code and runs tests
            # The --no-daemon flag is often recommended for CI environments to ensure a clean state for each run
            - name: Build with Gradle
              run: ./gradlew build --no-daemon

            # Step 5 (Optional): Upload build reports
            # This step runs only if the build step fails (failure())
            # It uploads the build reports, which can be downloaded from the workflow run page for easier debugging
            - name: Upload build reports on failure
              if: failure()
