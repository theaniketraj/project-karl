/*
 * KARL Desktop Example Application - Main Entry Point
 * 
 * This file demonstrates a complete integration of the KARL (Kotlin Adaptive Reasoning Learner)
 * framework within a Jetpack Compose desktop application. It showcases the framework's core
 * capabilities including adaptive learning, prediction generation, and user interaction processing
 * in a privacy-first, local environment.
 * 
 * **Application Architecture:**
 * - Mock implementations of core KARL interfaces for standalone demonstration
 * - Reactive UI built with Jetpack Compose showing real-time learning progress
 * - Event-driven interaction simulation through user interface controls
 * - Complete lifecycle management with proper resource cleanup
 * 
 * **Key Demonstration Features:**
 * - Local machine learning without external dependencies
 * - Real-time adaptation to user interaction patterns
 * - State persistence and recovery across application sessions
 * - Interactive UI for triggering learning events and observing predictions
 * 
 * **Mock Implementation Strategy:**
 * This example uses simplified mock implementations to demonstrate KARL concepts
 * without requiring heavyweight ML libraries. In production applications, these
 * would be replaced with:
 * - KotlinDL-based learning engines (karl-kldl module)
 * - SQLDelight-based persistent storage (karl-room module) 
 * - Real application data sources (user input, sensors, etc.)
 * 
 * **Privacy and Local Processing:**
 * All learning and processing occurs entirely on the local device, demonstrating
 * KARL's privacy-first approach. No data is transmitted to external services,
 * ensuring complete user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

/**
 * Mock implementation of the LearningEngine interface for demonstration purposes.
 * 
 * This simplified learning engine provides a working example of the KARL learning
 * paradigm without requiring heavyweight machine learning libraries. It demonstrates
 * the core concepts of incremental learning, state persistence, and prediction
 * generation using a simple interaction counter as the "learned knowledge."
 * 
 * **Learning Algorithm Simulation:**
 * - Maintains an interaction counter as the primary "learned" parameter
 * - Increments the counter for each training step to simulate learning progress
 * - Uses counter value to determine prediction confidence and suggestions
 * - Persists counter state for demonstration of state save/load capabilities
 * 
 * **State Management:**
 * - Serializes the interaction counter as a simple byte array
 * - Supports state loading and restoration for session continuity
 * - Implements proper initialization from both fresh and saved states
 * 
 * **Prediction Strategy:**
 * - Low confidence predictions until sufficient interactions are processed
 * - High confidence predictions after learning threshold is reached
 * - Demonstrates how learning progress affects prediction quality
 * 
 * **Production Replacement:**
 * In production applications, this would be replaced with sophisticated ML engines
 * such as neural networks, decision trees, or ensemble methods implemented through
 * the karl-kldl module using KotlinDL or similar frameworks.

/*
 * ========================================
 * MAIN APPLICATION ENTRY POINT
 * ========================================
 * 
 * This section implements the complete desktop application entry point with
 * proper KARL framework integration, lifecycle management, and resource cleanup.
 */

/**
 * Main application entry point for the KARL Desktop Example.
 * 
 * This function demonstrates a complete integration of the KARL framework within
 * a Jetpack Compose desktop application, showcasing proper component lifecycle
 * management, dependency coordination, and resource cleanup patterns that should
 * be followed in production applications.
 * 
 * **Application Architecture Demonstration:**
 * - Dependency injection pattern with mock implementations
 * - Proper coroutine scope management tied to application lifecycle
 * - Complete KARL container initialization and configuration
 * - Reactive UI integration with real-time state updates
 * - Comprehensive resource cleanup and state persistence
 * 
 * **Lifecycle Management Features:**
 * - Automatic KARL initialization during application startup
 * - State persistence during application shutdown for learning continuity
 * - Proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks and corruption
 * - Graceful error handling with comprehensive logging
 * 
 * **Production Integration Patterns:**
 * This example demonstrates how production applications should:
 * - Structure KARL component dependencies and initialization
 * - Manage coroutine scopes for proper lifecycle coordination
 * - Handle application shutdown with state preservation
 * - Integrate KARL containers with UI frameworks reactively
 * 
 * **Mock Implementation Strategy:**
 * Uses simplified mock implementations to demonstrate core concepts without
 * requiring heavyweight dependencies, making the example self-contained
 * and easy to understand for developers learning the framework.
 * 
 * **Privacy and Local Processing:**
 * Demonstrates KARL's privacy-first approach with all processing occurring
 * locally on the device without external network dependencies or data transmission.
