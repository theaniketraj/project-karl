 * This file defines the core interfaces that form the backbone of the KARL (Kotlin Adaptive
 * Reasoning Learner) system architecture. These interfaces establish the fundamental contracts
 * for AI learning, data management, and container orchestration while maintaining strict
 * separation of concerns and enabling flexible implementation strategies.
 *
 * Architecture principles:
 * - Interface segregation: Each interface has a single, well-defined responsibility
 * - Dependency inversion: Abstractions depend on other abstractions, not concretions
 * - Open/closed principle: Interfaces are stable while allowing diverse implementations
 * - Composition over inheritance: Complex behaviors emerge from interface combinations
 *
 * The interfaces defined here are:
 * 1. LearningEngine - Encapsulates AI/ML model training and inference capabilities
 * 2. KarlContainer - Orchestrates the complete KARL system lifecycle and coordination
 *
 * These core interfaces work in conjunction with supporting interfaces defined elsewhere:
 * - DataStorage (models package) - Persistent state and interaction data management
 * - DataSource (models package) - Application event integration and data collection
 *
 * Implementation considerations:
 * - All interfaces are designed for concurrent access from multiple threads
 * - Implementations must handle cancellation and cleanup gracefully
 * - Error propagation follows Kotlin coroutines conventions
 * - State management includes serialization and migration support

/**
 * Defines the contract for AI/ML learning engines that power KARL's adaptive capabilities.
 *
 * The LearningEngine interface abstracts the core machine learning functionality, enabling
 * KARL to work with different AI/ML libraries and algorithms while maintaining a consistent
 * API. This abstraction allows for hot-swapping of learning implementations based on
 * performance requirements, resource constraints, or domain-specific needs.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - **Incremental learning**: Process streaming interaction data and update models continuously
 * - **Prediction generation**: Provide real-time suggestions and insights based on learned patterns
 * - **State management**: Serialize/deserialize model state for persistence across sessions
 * - **Resource management**: Efficiently utilize memory and computational resources
 * - **Error handling**: Gracefully handle malformed data and recovery scenarios
 *
 * Implementation strategies:
 *
 * **Deep Learning Engines** (e.g., KLDLLearningEngine):
 * - Use neural networks for complex pattern recognition
 * - Suitable for large datasets and sophisticated behavioral modeling
 * - Higher memory and computational requirements
 * - Better accuracy for complex, non-linear relationships
 *
 * **Statistical Learning Engines**:
 * - Use classical ML algorithms (decision trees, clustering, regression)
 * - Lighter resource footprint, faster training and inference
 * - Suitable for simpler patterns and resource-constrained environments
 * - More interpretable models and predictions
 *
 * **Hybrid Engines**:
 * - Combine multiple learning approaches for different data types
 * - Use ensemble methods to improve prediction reliability
 * - Adaptive algorithm selection based on data characteristics
 * - Balanced performance across diverse use cases
 *
 * Design patterns for implementation:
 *
 * **Model Architecture**:
 * - Define clear input/output schemas for interaction data
 * - Use appropriate feature engineering for domain-specific patterns
 * - Implement proper normalization and preprocessing pipelines
 * - Support incremental learning without catastrophic forgetting
 *
 * **State Management**:
 * - Serialize complete model state including weights, hyperparameters, and metadata
 * - Support versioned state formats for backward compatibility
 * - Implement efficient delta updates for large models
 * - Handle corrupted state recovery and initialization fallbacks
 *
 * **Performance Optimization**:
 * - Use batch processing for training efficiency when appropriate
 * - Implement model pruning and compression for deployment
 * - Cache frequently accessed predictions and intermediate results
 * - Support hardware acceleration (GPU, specialized processors) when available
 *
 * **Thread Safety and Concurrency**:
 * - Ensure all methods are safe for concurrent access
 * - Use appropriate synchronization for model updates vs. predictions
 * - Support cancellation of long-running training operations
 * - Implement proper cleanup for background processing tasks
 *
 * Integration with KARL ecosystem:
 * - Coordinate with DataStorage for state persistence
 * - Process events from DataSource in real-time or batch mode
 * - Respect KarlInstructions for user-defined learning preferences
 * - Provide insights for UI components and monitoring systems
 *
 * Quality assurance considerations:
 * - Implement comprehensive unit tests for all learning algorithms
 * - Use property-based testing for edge cases and data variations
 * - Monitor prediction accuracy and model performance over time
 * - Provide debugging and introspection capabilities for model behavior
 *
 * This interface supports the core KARL principle of privacy-first, on-device learning
 * by ensuring that all training and inference operations remain local to the user's device.
 * Implementations must never transmit raw interaction data or model states to external
 * services without explicit user consent and proper encryption.

     * for new users and state restoration for returning users, enabling seamless continuation
     * of learning across application sessions.
     *
     * Initialization process:
     * 1. **Resource allocation**: Set up computational resources (memory, threads, accelerators)
     * 2. **Model construction**: Build or restore neural network/ML model architecture
     * 3. **State restoration**: Load weights, parameters, and learning history if available
     * 4. **Validation**: Verify model integrity and compatibility with current system
     * 5. **Background setup**: Initialize async processing pipelines and monitoring
     *
     * State handling scenarios:
     *
     * **New user initialization** (state == null):
     * - Create fresh model with random or pre-trained initialization
     * - Set up default hyperparameters and learning schedules
     * - Initialize empty interaction history and pattern buffers
     * - Configure baseline prediction capabilities
     *
     * **Returning user initialization** (state != null):
     * - Deserialize model weights and architecture from stored state
     * - Restore learning progress, hyperparameter schedules, and adaptation settings
     * - Validate state version compatibility and handle migrations if needed
     * - Resume learning from previous session's endpoint
     *
     * **Error recovery initialization**:
     * - Detect corrupted or incompatible state data
     * - Implement fallback to partial state or fresh initialization
     * - Log recovery actions for debugging and user notification
     * - Ensure graceful degradation without data loss
     *
     * Concurrency and lifecycle:
     * - The provided CoroutineScope manages all async operations within the engine
     * - Background tasks (training, optimization, cleanup) are launched within this scope
     * - Scope cancellation triggers graceful shutdown of all engine operations
     * - Resource cleanup is handled automatically when scope is cancelled
     *
     * Performance considerations:
     * - Initialization may be computationally expensive for large models
     * - Consider lazy initialization for rarely-used components
     * - Use appropriate thread pools for CPU vs. IO intensive operations
     * - Monitor memory usage and implement garbage collection strategies
     *
     * Error handling:
     * - Validation errors should provide clear diagnostic information
     * - State corruption should trigger automatic recovery procedures
     * - Resource allocation failures should fail fast with actionable error messages
     * - Network or IO errors should be retried with exponential backoff
     *
     * @param state Optional serialized state from previous sessions. Contains model weights,
     *              hyperparameters, learning history, and configuration. If null, initializes

     * Executes a single incremental learning step using new interaction data.
     *
     * This method implements the core adaptive learning capability that enables KARL to
     * continuously improve its understanding of user behavior. Each training step processes
     * one interaction event and updates the underlying model to incorporate new patterns
     * while preserving previously learned knowledge.
     *
     * Incremental learning approach:
     * - **Online learning**: Updates model immediately upon receiving new data
     * - **Streaming processing**: Handles continuous data flows without requiring batch accumulation
     * - **Memory efficiency**: Avoids storing large datasets by learning from individual samples
     * - **Real-time adaptation**: Enables immediate response to changing user behavior patterns
     *
     * Learning process:
     * 1. **Feature extraction**: Convert interaction data to numerical features for model input
     * 2. **Context integration**: Combine new data with recent interaction history for context
     * 3. **Model update**: Apply learning algorithms to adjust weights and parameters
     * 4. **Pattern validation**: Verify that new patterns don't contradict established knowledge
     * 5. **Performance monitoring**: Track learning metrics and adaptation effectiveness
     *
     * Data processing pipeline:
     *
     * **Input validation**:
     * - Verify interaction data format and completeness
     * - Check for data quality issues (missing fields, invalid timestamps)
     * - Filter out noise, duplicates, or irrelevant interactions
     * - Apply privacy filters to exclude sensitive information
     *
     * **Feature engineering**:
     * - Extract temporal patterns (time of day, frequency, duration)
     * - Encode categorical data (action types, context categories)
     * - Normalize numerical features for stable learning
     * - Generate derived features from interaction sequences
     *
     * **Learning algorithm execution**:
     * - Apply appropriate learning algorithm (gradient descent, reinforcement learning, etc.)
     * - Update model weights using calculated gradients and learning rates
     * - Adjust hyperparameters based on learning progress and performance
     * - Implement regularization to prevent overfitting to recent data
     *
     * **Model validation and quality control**:
     * - Check for catastrophic forgetting of previous patterns
     * - Validate that model outputs remain within expected ranges
     * - Monitor prediction accuracy on recent validation samples
     * - Detect and handle concept drift in user behavior
     *
     * Asynchronous execution patterns:
     * - Training may be computationally expensive and should not block calling thread
     * - Background processing allows UI responsiveness during intensive learning
     * - Job-based approach enables cancellation and progress monitoring
     * - Error handling and recovery can be managed independently
     *
     * Performance optimization strategies:
     * - **Micro-batching**: Accumulate multiple interactions for more efficient processing
     * - **Adaptive scheduling**: Vary learning frequency based on data volume and patterns
     * - **Resource throttling**: Limit CPU/memory usage to maintain system responsiveness
     * - **Smart caching**: Cache intermediate results to avoid redundant computations
     *
     * Error handling and robustness:
     * - Invalid data should be logged and ignored rather than causing failures
     * - Model instability should trigger rollback to previous stable state
     * - Resource exhaustion should gracefully degrade rather than crash
     * - Network or IO failures during training should be retried with backoff
     *
     * Integration with broader KARL system:
     * - Coordinate with prediction requests to avoid conflicts during model updates
     * - Trigger state persistence after significant learning milestones
     * - Respect user instructions that may modify learning behavior
     * - Provide progress updates for UI components and monitoring systems
