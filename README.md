**Project KARL is an open-source Kotlin library for building privacy-first, locally adaptive AI models that integrate seamlessly into applications using a unique composable container architecture.**

KARL empowers developers to add intelligent, personalized features without compromising user data privacy by performing all learning and inference directly on the user's device.

## Core Philosophy & Features ‚ú®

*   üß† **Local & Adaptive Learning:** KARL starts as a blank slate and learns incrementally from *individual user actions* within your application, creating truly personalized experiences. No massive pre-trained models, no assumptions ‚Äì just learning directly from usage.
*   üîí **Privacy-First by Design:** Zero data egress. All learning and inference happens *exclusively on the user's device*. User interaction metadata (not sensitive content) is stored locally and encrypted.
*   üß© **Composable Container Architecture:** KARL operates within a defined "Container" ‚Äì a logical and potentially visual sandbox. This provides clear boundaries for the AI's scope and enhances user trust and control.
*   ü§ù **Open-Source Core:** The fundamental KARL engine and container logic are open-source under the Apache License 2.0, fostering transparency, community contributions, and trust.
*   üöÄ **Kotlin Native:** Built primarily with Kotlin, leveraging Kotlin Multiplatform for the core logic and integrating naturally with modern Kotlin/JVM and Jetpack Compose applications.

## Motivation / Why KARL? ü§î

Traditional AI often requires sending user data to the cloud, creating significant privacy concerns, especially for sensitive data like developer workflows or personal habits. KARL offers an alternative: intelligent personalization *without* the data privacy trade-off. It's designed for applications where user trust and data locality are paramount.

While initially conceived as the foundation for a [proprietary SaaS application](<!-- Link to your SaaS if desired -->), the core KARL library is designed to be a general-purpose tool for any Kotlin developer looking to build private, on-device intelligence.
